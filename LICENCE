In the name of Hecate, Queen of all Witchcraft,
Goddess of Infernal Realms,
I invoke Lucifer,
The First Father of Man
He who guides the Ascending Soul on the Path of the Gods
Phosphoros, the Light Bearer,
God of Atlantean Magic!
Open the Way to your Stellar Realm,
Come from the Ancient Throne of Thaumiel,
Through the Gates of the Void,
In the Circle of the Night.
Lord of the Demon Princes,
Open the Gates to the Path of the Dragon,
And reveal to me secrets lost and forgotten,
The Wisdom of primordial Gods!
Lord of Darkness and Light,
I invite you to enter this flesh,
I call you to my body, my mind, and my soul,
I welcome you in my heart!
Lord of Ascending Flame,
Open for me the Way to your Throne,
Grant me the Keys to your Stellar Gates,
And guide me on the Paths of Limitless Power!
Lord of Thaumiel,Ignite the fire of my soul,
So that I could rise forged in your flames,
As the Living Grail of your Immortal Essence,
From the bonds of flesh to the Heart of your Golden Throne!
Emperor of Darkness and Flame,
Empower and protect my soul,
So that I could arise as the Living Vessel of Draconian Gnosis!
Great Horned King,
Enter this flesh which I offer you as Temple,
And let your immortal Blood flow through my veins!
Lucifer, Lord of Ascending Flame,
Let your Fire burn forever in my soul!
